This package is a collection of LearnR tutorials to go with my Data Analytics class and my Social Network Analysis class.

Using the remotes package, you can run `install_github("antoinevernet/DataAnalytics")` to install the package.
Then using the learnr package, you can run a tutorial with `run_tutorial(“tutorial_name”, package=”DataAnalytics”)`
