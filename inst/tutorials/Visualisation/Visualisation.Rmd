## Introduction

Looking at our data is a fundamental first step when starting any analysis. To do this we will create plots. In this tutorial, we will learn how to create plots using the package `ggplot2`.
We will use the data on the British Social Attitudes Survey (BSA) that we used in the previous tutorial.
We will use plots to look at the data and explore the relationship between political orientation and opinion about welfare. The plot below is one way to visualise this relationship. We will work through recreating this plot in the rest of the tutorial.

```{r plotex, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
bsa <- readRDS("./data/bsa2021_healthcare_equalities_recoded.rds")

bsa <- bsa |> mutate(welfare2 = if_else(welfare2 == 9, NA, welfare2),
                     leftrigh = if_else(leftrigh == 9, NA, leftrigh))
ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = DVSex21), alpha=0.05) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Welfare perception by political orientation",
       x = "Political orientation\n(1 = left, 5 = right)",
       y = "Welfare perception\n(1 = sympathetic, 5 = poor don't deserve)") +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(title = "Sex"))
```

We will start by loading the data and then create a simple plot using the package `ggplot2`, then we will start on the main task of this tutorial: recreating the plot above.


### Loading the BSA data

Remember the British Social Attitudes data from the previous tutorial? We will work with this data in this tutorial, so let's start by loading it.
The data to load is the RDS version of this data

Write the R code required:

```{r loaddta, exercise=TRUE}
bsa <- ____
```

```{r loaddta-solution}
bsa <- readRDS("./data/bsa2021_healthcare_equalities_recoded.rds")
```

## Your very first plot!

With this data loaded, we will create our very first plot using the package `ggplot2`.
You can indicate the data to use in the `ggplot()` function, and then specify the aesthetics of the plot in the `aes()` function: x is for the variable in the x axis, y for the one in the y axis.

```{r ggplot1, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="loaddta-solution"}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = ____, aes(x=____, y=____)) + 
  geom_point()


```

```{r ggplot1-hint}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=____, y=____)) + 
  geom_point()

```

```{r ggplot1-solution}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  geom_point()


```

As you can tell, it does not look like the initial plot. Before we move on to recreating that plot, let's examine the building blocks of a `ggplot` plot.


## ggplot

There are three main components to a `ggplot` graph: data, aesthetics, and geometries. The data provides the data frame to use, the aesthetics tells the which variables are mapped on which dimension (x, y, colour, shape, linetype), and the geometries are what is displayed using the data and the mapping (scatterplot, boxplot, etc).

### Data and mapping

Run the code to see what it produces.

```{r ggplot2, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="loaddta-solution"}

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2))


```

As you can see, this code only creates the canvas for the plot. We need to add at least one geometry to see the data.

### What is in a layer?

Adding the geometries adds layers to the plot. 
Add a layer to the plot with the `geom_point()` function to see the data points. You can also try adding another geometry, for example, `geom_smooth()`. You can also try adding both together. You'll see that depending which one you plot first, you will get a slightly different result as layers are plotted on top of one another in the order you add them to the plot.

```{r ggplot3, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="loaddta-solution"}

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  ____


```



## Building the example plot

You know have a better understanding of the different components needed to make a plot using `ggplot2`. Let's now recreate the plot we showed at the beginning of the tutorial (reproduced below for ease of reference).


```{r, ref.label = "plotex", warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

If we have another look at our first plot from above, we can spot one obvious difference.

```{r firstplot2, exercise=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, exercise.setup="loaddta-solution"}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  geom_point()
```

Both our leftrigh and our welfare2 variables have some values outside of the range that we expect (1-5). On closer inspection, the value of these data points is 9. What do they mean? This is when we need to refer to the codebook, which comes with the data. The relevant passage is reproduced below:

![](www/img/welfare2_bsa_codebook.png){#id .class width=50% height=50%}

This tells us that missing values have been coded as 9. Coding missing values as 9, 99, or 999 when it is a value out of the range of the values of the variable was a common practice. In fact, a lot of national statistic still do this, and code all the answers to their surveys like it is 1985. The British Social Attitudes survey is no exception, and the only reason the data you have seen is in a human readable form, is because we recoded it before giving it to you to work with to make your life easier.

The first thing we need to do then, is to recode these values to make them into missing values that R recognises as such.
In order to do this, we can use some of the functions we learned about in the previous tutorial that come with the `dplyr` package. We can use the `mutate()` and the `ifelse` functions to create a new variable that is the same as the old one, but with the values of 9 replaced with `NA`. We can do this for both the `leftrigh` and the `welfare2` variables. You can get help on both of these function by using `?` followed by the function name.

```{r recode, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="loaddta-solution"}
bsa <- bsa |> ____(welfare2 = ____(welfare2 == 9, NA, welfare2),
                     leftrigh = ____(leftrigh == 9, NA, leftrigh))

# Check what the plot looks like now

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  geom_point()
```


```{r recode-solution, exercise.setup="loaddta-solution"}
bsa <- bsa |> mutate(welfare2 = if_else(welfare2 == 9, NA, welfare2),
                     leftrigh = if_else(leftrigh == 9, NA, leftrigh))

```


Now that we removed the missing values, we can start making the plot look nicer. The first thing to do is to add all the geoms that we want to see in the final plot. We already have `geom_point`, but in the finished plots, we also controlled the shape of the points based on the sex of the respondents, finally we also played with transparency. Then we had also added another geom: `geom_smooth`. In order to complete the plot, add the right argument inside the aes of `geom_point`. Keep in mind that you can check what is in the data by using the name of the data object to display it (`bsa`) or using the `head()` function.

```{r finplot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, exercise=TRUE, exercise.setup="recode-solution"}

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(____), alpha=0.05) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE)

```


```{r finplot-solution, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

ggplot(data = bsa, aes(x=leftrigh, y=welfare2)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape = DVSex21), alpha=0.05) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Welfare perception by political orientation",
       x = "Political orientation\n(1 = left, 5 = right)",
       y = "Welfare perception\n(1 = sympathetic, 5 = poor don't deserve)") +
  guides(shape = guide_legend(title = "Sex"))
```
