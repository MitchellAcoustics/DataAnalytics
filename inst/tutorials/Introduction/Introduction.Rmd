## Welcome!

Welcome to this introductory tutorial on using R. This series of tutorials are companions to the course material for several courses at UCL BSSC: BCPM0094 Data Analytics for Project Managers and BCPM0049 Social Network Analysis. They focus primarily on helping you with using R with a focus on the tools that are useful to complete the courses. This means that they are by no means a complete overview of what you can do with R and jump over some topics that would usually be covered in an introduction to R, this also means that they cover some more advanced material that you would usually not find in an introduction to R. 
There are many more complete (and amazing) resources on R and on causal inference. Below are a few of the ones that we often refer to in the course:

- R for Data Science (2nd Edition) https://r4ds.hadley.nz/preface-2e
- The Effect
- Causal Inference: The Mixtape
- Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction


Whenever possible, I will indicate where in these resources to find additional material.

## Structure of the tutorials!

The tutorials are organised as follow:

Tutorial 1: The basics

- The bases (chapter 2 of R4DS)
- data transformation (chapter 3 of R4DS) dplyr on rows and column, the pipe, groups
- data import (chapter 7)


Tutorial 2: Basic Visualisation

- ggplot2 chapter 9 of r4ds
- exploratory data analysis (chapter 10 r4ds)
- labels, legends (chapter 11)


Tutorial 3: Types and data structures

Vectors, numbers, string, factors, dates, missing values

Link...

Tutorial 4: data in and out (csv, spreadsheets, databases, hierarchical data)

Link...

Tutorial 5: functions, iteration

Link...

Tutorial 6: descriptive analysis

More data wrangling using bsa data and babynames.
Things like pivot_wider, pivot_longer and join, plus some more mutate and friends.

Link...


Tutorial 7: Regression basics

Is bsa still the right dataset for that?
- linear regression


Tutorial 8: Data is dirty

Does the causal inference from here needs its own package?

Tutorial: More types of regression
- logistic regression
- model diagnostics
- model selection



Tutorial 8: Adjusting for confounders

Tutorial 9: Instrumental variables

The social network tutorials need their own package?
Tutorial 8: Social Network Analysis basics

Tutorial 9: Network visualisation



The rest of this tutorial walks you through installing R and RStudio and demonstrates how the tutorials work.


## Getting started

If you have not yet installed R and RStudio, please see the following material:

- links!!!

### The simplest exercise ever

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

As you can see, R is a calculator, but it is much more than this. It is a fully-fledged programming language, in the limit, you can write any piece of software in R. 


This is the end of this first tutorial, you can now start the next tutorial: The Basics
