## Welcome!

Welcome to this introductory tutorial on using R. This series of tutorials are companions to the course material for several courses at UCL BSSC: BCPM0094 Data Analytics for Project Managers and BCPM0049 Social Network Analysis. They focus primarily on helping you with using R with a focus on the tools that are useful to complete the courses. This means that they are by no means a complete overview of what you can do with R and jump over some topics that would usually be covered in an introduction to R, this also means that they cover some more advanced material that you would usually not find in an introduction to R. 
There are many more complete (and amazing) resources on R and on causal inference. Below are a few of the ones that we often refer to in the course:

- R for Data Science (2nd Edition) https://r4ds.hadley.nz/preface-2e
- The Effect
- Causal Inference: The Mixtape
- Data Visualization: A Practical Introduction


Whenever possible, I will indicate where in these resources to find additional material.

## Structure of the tutorials!

The tutorials are organised as follow:

Tutorial 1: The basics
- The bases (chapter 2 of R4DS)
- data transformation (chapter 3 of R4DS) dplyr on rows and column, the pipe, groups
- data import (chapter 7)

Tutorial 2: Basic Visualisation
- ggplot2 chapter 9 of r4ds
- exploratory data analysis (chapter 10 r4ds)
- labels, legends (chapter 11)

Tutorial 3: Types

Vectors, numbers, string, factors, dates, missing values

Tutorial 5: functions, iteration

## Getting started

If you have not yet installed R and RStudio, please see the following material:

- links!!!

### The simplest exercise ever

Write the R code required to add two plus two:

```{r two-plus-two, exercise=TRUE}

```

As you can see, R is a calculator, but it is much more than this. It is a fully-fleshed programming language, in the limit, you can write any piece of software in R. 


### Exercise with Code

*Here's an exercise with some prepopulated code as well as `exercise.lines = 5` to provide a bit more initial room to work.*

Now write a function that adds any two numbers and then call it:

```{r add-function, exercise=TRUE, exercise.lines = 5}
add <- function() {
  
}
```

## Topic 2

### Exercise with Hint

*Here's an exercise where the chunk is pre-evaluated via the `exercise.eval` option (so the user can see the default output we'd like them to customize). We also add a "hint" to the correct solution via the chunk immediate below labeled `print-limit-hint`.*

Modify the following code to limit the number of rows printed to 5:

```{r print-limit, exercise=TRUE, exercise.eval=TRUE}
mtcars
```

```{r print-limit-hint}
head(mtcars)
```

### Quiz

*You can include any number of single or multiple choice questions as a quiz. Use the `question` function to define a question and the `quiz` function for grouping multiple questions together.*

Some questions to verify that you understand the purposes of various base and recommended R packages:

```{r quiz}
quiz(
  question("Which package contains functions for installing other R packages?",
    answer("base"),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("utils", correct = TRUE),
    answer("codetools")
  ),
  question("Which of the R packages listed below are used to create plots?",
    answer("lattice", correct = TRUE),
    answer("tools"),
    answer("stats"),
    answer("grid", correct = TRUE)
  )
)
```
